## ✅ What Works Right Now

### Option 1: PDF Generation (Recommended for Now) ✅
```bash
cd backend
npm run daily-report-pdf
```

**What happens:**
- Queries database for new chapters/officers (last 24h)
- Queries high-grade chapters (4.5+)
- Generates HTML files for each client
- Saves to `reports/[date]/` folder
- You manually email them

**Output:**
```
✓ Successful: 2 reports generated
📧 Files: reports/2025-10-08/daily-report-2025-10-08-hedge-inc.html
```

**Next step:** Open HTML in browser, review, email to clients

---

### Option 2: Automated Email (Needs Domain Verification) ⏳
```bash
cd backend
npm run daily-report
```

**Current status:**
- ✅ Works for jacksonfitzgerald25@gmail.com
- ❌ Fails for other emails (domain not verified)

**To fix:**
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add and verify `fraternitybase.com`
3. Update `.env`: `FROM_EMAIL=updates@fraternitybase.com`
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

**Then:** Fully automated daily emails at 8 AM EST!
