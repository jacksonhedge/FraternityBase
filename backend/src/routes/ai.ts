## COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: How do warm intros work for Team subscribers?**
A: New Team subscribers get 1 warm introduction that's valid for their first 3 months. After 3 months, they must purchase additional warm intros or upgrade to Enterprise.

**Q: What happens when unlocks reset?**
A: Monthly subscriptions reset unlock allowances on the billing renewal date via the invoice.payment_succeeded webhook. Unused unlocks don't roll over.

**Q: Can customers mix subscription unlocks and credits?**
A: Yes! Subscription unlocks are used first. Once depleted, the system uses credits from their balance.

**Q: How are Platinum chapters different?**
A: Platinum chapters are premium listings with verified data and warm intro capabilities. They cost the standard rate based on their star rating.

**Q: What's the auto-reload feature?**
A: Customers can set a threshold (min $5) and reload amount (min $25). When balance drops below threshold, auto-reload charges their saved payment method.
