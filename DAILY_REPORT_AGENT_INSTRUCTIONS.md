## Key Things Agent Must Know

### Critical Business Logic

**4.5+ Grade = Introducable** ü§ù
- Warm introduction available ($59.99)
- Partnership network access
- Competitive advantage
- KEEP CONFIDENTIAL: College Casino Tour relationship

**Grade Tiers**:
- 5.0 = Premium (40 credits)
- 4.5 = Introducable (25 credits)
- 4.0-4.4 = High Quality (25 credits)
- 3.5-3.9 = Standard (20 credits)
- <3.5 = Basic (20 credits)

### Database Relationships

```
companies (approved clients)
  ‚Üì (user_profiles)
auth.users (emails)

chapters (89)
  ‚Üê universities (1,106)
  ‚Üê greek_organizations (30)
  ‚Üí chapter_officers (160)
  ‚Üí chapter_unlocks (tracks purchases)
```

### RLS Important

Use `supabaseAdmin` (service role) for reporting, not regular `supabase` client. RLS blocks regular queries on:
- chapter_unlocks
- balance_transactions
- credit_transactions

## PDF Generation Option

If automated email doesn't work (domain verification issue), agent can generate PDF instead:

### Steps to Add PDF Generation

1. **Install puppeteer**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install puppeteer
```

2. **Create PDF generation script**:
```typescript
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

async function generatePDF(html: string, filename: string) {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.setContent(html);
  await page.pdf({
    path: filename,
    format: 'A4',
    printBackground: true
  });
  await browser.close();
}
```

3. **Generate PDFs for each company**:
```bash
# Agent would run modified script
npm run daily-report-pdf
# Outputs: daily-report-2025-10-08-hedge-inc.pdf
```

4. **User manually sends PDFs via email**
