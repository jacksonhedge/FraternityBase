### Steps to Test:

     - Password
   - Check for validation errors
   - Submit the form

3. **Email Verification**
   - Check if email verification is required

4. **Profile Completion**
   - After sign-up, check if there's a profile completion flow:
     - Chapter details (charter date, member count)
     - Social media handles
     - Contact information

     - Officer information

5. **Take Screenshots**

## 2. Fraternity Dashboard

### Test Objective
Explore the main dashboard that chapters see after logging in.

### Steps to Test:

1. **Login as a Chapter**
   - Use credentials from sign-up (or create a test account)

2. **Dashboard Overview**
   - Identify main sections/widgets
   - Check what data is displayed:
     - Chapter statistics?
     - Partnership requests?
     - Upcoming events?
     - Recent activity?
   - Look for navigation menu

3. **Explore Key Features**
   - **Partnership Requests** (if visible):
     - Can chapters see incoming partnership offers?
     - Can they accept/reject requests?
     - Is compensation clearly displayed?

4. **Navigation & UX**
   - Test all menu items
   - Check if sidebar/header is clear
   - **IMPORTANT DESIGN REQUIREMENT**:
     - Left sidebar menu should have its OWN scrollability (independent scroll from main content)
     - NavBar content should be pinned/frozen at the BOTTOM of the left sidebar (like a frozen row in Google Sheets, but vertical)
     - When you scroll the left menu, the NavBar stays stuck at the bottom
     - NavBar should NOT be a horizontal bar at the top
   - Look for: User account info, settings, logout buttons at the bottom of the left menu, overlaid/frozen there
   - Test: Scroll the left menu to see if NavBar stays pinned at bottom
   - Try mobile view (resize browser)

5. **Take Screenshots**
   - Dashboard home screen
   - Each major section (partnerships, profile, settings, etc.)
   - Mobile view
   - Any empty states (if no data)

### What to Look For:
- ‚úÖ Clear value proposition (why is this useful?)
- ‚úÖ Easy navigation
- ‚úÖ Important info is prominent
- ‚úÖ Actions are clear (buttons, CTAs)
- ‚úÖ Left sidebar has independent scrollability (can scroll menu items separately from main content)
- ‚úÖ NavBar content is pinned at bottom of left sidebar (frozen/overlaid, stays put when scrolling menu)
- ‚ùå Cluttered or confusing layout
- ‚ùå Missing or unclear features
- ‚ùå Slow loading times
- ‚ùå NavBar is still a horizontal bar at the top (should be moved to left sidebar bottom)
- ‚ùå Left sidebar doesn't scroll independently
- ‚ùå NavBar scrolls away when scrolling the left menu (should stay pinned)
