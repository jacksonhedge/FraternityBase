## üîç Key Things to Look For

1. **"Unlock for Credits" Text**
   - Should ONLY appear when subscription unlocks = 0
   - If you have unlocks available, seeing this text = BUG

2. **Modal Color**
   - Purple/gradient = Subscription unlock (good)
   - Gray/blue = Credit unlock (good)
   - Wrong color for scenario = BUG

3. **Balance Changes**
   - Subscription unlock ‚Üí subscription count decreases, credits unchanged
   - Credit unlock ‚Üí credits decrease, subscription unchanged
   - Any other behavior = BUG

4. **Unwanted Fields**
   - "Greek Rank" anywhere = FAIL
   - "Chapter GPA" anywhere = FAIL
   - These should be completely removed

5. **Grading on Locked Chapters**
   - Should be impossible
   - If allowed = SECURITY ISSUE
