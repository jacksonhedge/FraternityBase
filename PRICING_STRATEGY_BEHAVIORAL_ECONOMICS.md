- **Below 3.5:** 20 credits ($5.99)

---

- **5.0 Grade:** $9.99 (in credits)
- **2.0-3.0 Grade:** $0.99 (iTunes-style)
- **Enterprise Discount:** 85% off all unlocks
- **Psychological Pricing:** .99 endings

---

## Behavioral Economics Analysis

### 1. **Charm Pricing ($.99 Effect)** ✅ STRONG RECOMMENDATION

**Psychology:** Prices ending in .99 are perceived as significantly cheaper than round numbers.

**Research:**
- $9.99 feels closer to $9 than $10 (left-digit effect)
- $0.99 triggers "bargain" mental category
- iTunes pioneered this for digital goods successfully

**Application to Your System:**
```
5.0 Grade:  $9.99  (feels like ~$9, not $10)
4.5 Grade:  $6.99  (feels like ~$6, not $7)
4.0 Grade:  $4.99  (feels like ~$4, not $5)
3.5 Grade:  $2.99  (feels like ~$2, not $3)
3.0 Grade:  $1.99  (feels like ~$1, not $2)
Below 3.0: $0.99  (impulse purchase tier)
```

**✅ Verdict:** Absolutely use .99 pricing. It's proven to increase conversions by 8-24%.

---

### 2. **Price Anchoring** 🎯 CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS

**Psychology:** First price seen becomes the reference point for all other prices.

**Strategy:**
```
Display Order (left to right):
[5.0 - $9.99]  [4.5 - $6.99]  [4.0 - $4.99]  [3.5 - $2.99]  [<3.0 - $0.99]
     ⬆️
  ANCHOR
```

**Why This Works:**
- $9.99 anchor makes $6.99 feel reasonable
- $6.99 makes $4.99 feel like a deal
- By the time users see $0.99, it feels like "basically free"

**UI Recommendation:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  UNLOCK PRICING                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Premium 5★  →  $9.99   [Most Popular] │
│  Quality 4.5★ →  $6.99                 │
│  Good 4.0★    →  $4.99   [Best Value]  │
│  Standard 3.5★ →  $2.99                │
│  Basic <3.0★  →  $0.99   [Budget Pick] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**✅ Verdict:** Show highest price first to anchor value perception.

---

### 3. **Decoy Pricing (Asymmetric Dominance)** 🦆

**Psychology:** Adding a "decoy" option makes target option look more attractive.

**Example:**
```
Option A: 4.0 Grade - $4.99
Option B: 4.5 Grade - $6.99  ← TARGET
Option C: 4.3 Grade - $6.49  ← DECOY (worse value than B)
```

**In Your System:**
- Most users should choose 4.5-5.0 chapters (highest revenue)
- Make 4.0 look like "okay value"
- Make 4.5 look like "smart choice"
- Make 5.0 look like "premium but worth it"

**✅ Verdict:** Price gaps should encourage 4.5-5.0 purchases, not 3.0-4.0.

---

### 4. **Tiered Value Perception** 📊

**Current Problem:**
```
Your Proposal: 5.0 = $9.99, 3.0 = $0.99
Price Ratio: 10:1

This is GOOD but could be optimized.
```

**Behavioral Insight:**
- 10:1 ratio signals quality difference BUT might make low-tier seem "worthless"
- Users might think: "If 3.0 is only $0.99, how bad is it?"

**Better Approach:**
```
5.0 = $9.99  (premium)
4.5 = $6.99  (70% of premium, still valuable)
4.0 = $4.99  (50% of premium, solid choice)
3.5 = $2.99  (30% of premium, budget option)
3.0 = $1.99  (20% of premium, entry-level)
<3.0 = $0.99 (loss leader/impulse)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Graduated pricing maintains value perception across all tiers
- $1.99 feels more substantial than $0.99 (not "worthless")
- Still cheap enough for budget buyers
- Preserves brand value

**✅ Verdict:** Use graduated pricing, reserve $0.99 for <3.0 only.

---

### 5. **The "$0.99 iTunes Strategy"** 💿 PROVEN MODEL

**What iTunes Did Right:**
- $0.99 = impulse purchase (no deliberation)
- Low enough to avoid "Is this worth it?" question
- High enough to not feel worthless

**Application:**
- **$0.99 Tier:** Only for chapters rated <3.0 (damaged goods, low demand)
- Creates "bargain bin" category
- Converts users who would never pay $5+
- Builds habit of unlocking

**When to Use $0.99:**
- Chapters with major issues (suspended, low ratings, etc.)
- Sororities at small schools (lower demand)
- Old/inactive chapters
- "Clearance sale" feeling

**✅ Verdict:** $0.99 is perfect for bottom tier, but don't overuse it.

---

### 6. **Enterprise 85% Discount Analysis** 🏢

**Your Proposal:** Enterprise clients get 85% off

**Math:**
```
Normal Pricing:
5.0 chapter = $9.99
4.5 chapter = $6.99

With 85% off:
5.0 chapter = $1.50
4.5 chapter = $1.05
```

**Behavioral Issues:**
1. **Too generous?** Leaves almost no revenue per unlock
2. **Expectation setting:** Hard to upsell later
3. **Perceived value:** If enterprise pays $1.50, what's the "real" value?

**Better Approach - Tiered Enterprise Pricing:**
```
Enterprise "Pro" (250 unlocks/month):
- 50% off all unlocks
- 5.0 = $4.99
- 4.0 = $2.49
- 3.0 = $0.99

Enterprise "Elite" (unlimited unlocks):
- Flat monthly fee ($299-$499/month)
- Unlimited unlocks
- No per-chapter cost
```

**Why This is Better:**
1. **Higher revenue:** 50% off > 85% off
2. **Value perception:** Still feels like huge discount
3. **Predictable costs:** Flat fee for enterprise budgets
4. **Usage incentive:** Unlimited tier drives engagement

**✅ Verdict:** 50-60% discount for Enterprise, or flat unlimited fee.

---

### 7. **Credit vs. Dollar Framing** 💳

**You said:** "Credits not dollars"

**Psychological Difference:**
```
Dollar Framing: "This chapter costs $9.99"
Credit Framing: "This chapter costs 10 credits"
```

**Research:**
- Credits feel less like "spending money"
- Casinos use chips for this reason
- Mobile games use gems/coins

**Recommendation:**
```
Display Format:
"Unlock for 10 credits ($9.99 value)"
         ⬆️            ⬆️
      Primary      Anchor/Context
```

**Why:**
- Credits = less pain of payment
- Dollar value = anchors perceived worth
- Hybrid = best of both worlds

**✅ Verdict:** Use credit pricing but show dollar value for context.
