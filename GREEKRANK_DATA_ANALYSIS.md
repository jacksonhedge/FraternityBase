## Strategic Use Cases

### 1. **Chapter Discovery & Database Expansion** üéØ HIGH PRIORITY

**Opportunity:** We currently have **97 chapters** in FraternityBase. GreekRank has **7,991 fraternity chapters** (since we focus on fraternities, not sororities).

**Strategy:**
- Use GreekRank data to discover chapters at universities we already support
- Expand to new universities with high fraternity density
- Prioritize top-tier universities (Penn State, Alabama, Florida State, Ohio State, etc.)

**Implementation:**
1. Match universities by name (fuzzy matching)
2. For matched universities, import missing chapters
3. For new universities, create university records first
4. Import chapter data with proper organization linking

**Impact:** Could grow database from 97 to 1,000+ chapters within weeks

---

### 2. **Organization Data Validation & Enrichment** ‚úÖ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Opportunity:** Validate and enrich existing chapter data with authoritative GreekRank information.

**Strategy:**
- Cross-reference chapter names to ensure accuracy
- Add Greek letters (Œ£Œß, Œ¶ŒîŒò) to chapters that don't have them
- Validate organization status (active/inactive)
- Add GreekRank profile URLs for external reference

**Implementation:**
1. Match existing chapters by university + organization name
2. Update `greek_letters` field if missing
3. Add new `greekrank_url` field to chapters table
4. Flag chapters as "verified by GreekRank"

**Impact:** Improved data quality and external validation source

---

### 3. **Greek Letters Display** üé® HIGH PRIORITY

**Opportunity:** Currently, chapters display as "Sigma Chi" but could display with authentic Greek letters: "Œ£Œß".

**Strategy:**
- Add `greek_letters` field to chapters table
- Display Greek letters in chapter cards, detail pages, and search results
- Improves visual appeal and authenticity

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE chapters ADD COLUMN greek_letters VARCHAR(10);
```

**UI Mockup:**
```
Before: Sigma Chi at Penn State
After:  Sigma Chi (Œ£Œß) at Penn State
```

**Impact:** More professional and authentic presentation

---

### 4. **GreekRank Integration & External Links** üîó LOW PRIORITY

**Opportunity:** Link directly to GreekRank profiles for additional chapter insights.

**Strategy:**
- Store GreekRank URL for each chapter
- Add "View on GreekRank" button on chapter detail pages
- Use GreekRank as external validation source

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE chapters ADD COLUMN greekrank_url VARCHAR(255);
```

**Impact:** Provides users with additional research resources

---

### 5. **University Coverage Expansion** üåç MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Opportunity:** GreekRank covers **819 universities** vs our current limited set.

**Sample Universities in GreekRank:**
- Florida State University - FSU
- Miami University of Ohio - MU
- Indiana University Bloomington - IU
- University of Mississippi - Ole Miss
- The University of Oklahoma - OU
- MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford
- All major state universities
- Many smaller liberal arts colleges

**Strategy:**
- Import top 100 universities by fraternity density
- Focus on schools with 20+ fraternities
- Prioritize schools in key recruiting regions (Southeast, Midwest)

**Implementation:**
1. Analyze fraternity density per university
2. Rank universities by chapter count
3. Import top N universities
4. Batch import chapters for those universities

**Impact:** 10x increase in geographic coverage

---

### 6. **Sorority Data (Future Consideration)** üë• FUTURE

**Opportunity:** Dataset includes **5,313 sorority chapters**.

**Strategy:**
- While FraternityBase currently focuses on fraternities, this data could support:
  - Expansion to sororities in future
  - Panhellenic partnerships
  - Whole Greek Life platform

**Implementation:** Archive sorority data for future use

---

## Data Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths:
- **Comprehensive coverage:** 819 universities, 13K+ organizations
- **Structured format:** Clean JSON with consistent schema
- **Greek letters:** Unicode characters for authentic display
- **External links:** Direct GreekRank URLs for validation
- **Organization types:** Clear fraternity/sorority classification

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- **No ratings/rankings:** Only links to rating pages, not actual rating data
- **Missing Instagram handles:** Mostly null (but we can fetch via API)
- **No contact information:** No emails, phones, addresses
- **No officer data:** Would need separate scraping
- **University websites:** Mostly null
- **No founding dates:** Would enhance chapter profiles

### üîÑ Data Freshness:
- Scraped: October 14, 2025 (2:04 AM - 2:29 AM based on batch timestamps)
- Status: All chapters marked "active" (needs validation)
- Update frequency: Would need periodic re-scraping

---

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Schema Updates (1-2 hours)
```sql
-- Add new columns to chapters table
ALTER TABLE chapters
ADD COLUMN greek_letters VARCHAR(10),
ADD COLUMN greekrank_url VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN greekrank_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Create index for lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_chapters_greekrank ON chapters(greekrank_url);
```

### Phase 2: Data Import Script (2-4 hours)
Create: `/backend/src/scripts/import_greekrank.ts`

**Features:**
- Read all 17 batch JSON files
- Match universities by name (fuzzy matching)
- For existing universities:
  - Import missing chapters
  - Update existing chapters with Greek letters + GreekRank URL
- For new universities:
  - Create university record
  - Import all chapters
- Skip sororities (filter by organization_type)
- Log import statistics

**Matching Strategy:**
```typescript
// University name matching
"Penn State University" ‚Üí "Pennsylvania State University - Penn State -"
"University of Alabama" ‚Üí "The University of Alabama - UA -"

// Chapter matching
University + Organization Name ‚Üí Unique chapter
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Display (1-2 hours)
- Add Greek letters to chapter cards
- Display "(Œ£Œß)" next to chapter names
- Add "View on GreekRank" external link icon
- Show "Verified by GreekRank" badge

### Phase 4: Quality Scoring Enhancement (Optional)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: University Name Matching
**Problem:** "Penn State" vs "Pennsylvania State University - Penn State -"

**Solution:**
```typescript
function fuzzyMatchUniversity(ourName: string, greekRankName: string): boolean {
  // Normalize names
  const normalize = (str: string) =>
    str.toLowerCase()
       .replace(/university|college|the|-|,/g, '')
       .trim();

  const normalized1 = normalize(ourName);
  const normalized2 = normalize(greekRankName);

  // Check if one contains the other
  return normalized1.includes(normalized2) ||
         normalized2.includes(normalized1);
}
```

### Challenge 2: Duplicate Detection
**Problem:** Prevent duplicate chapters on import

**Solution:**
- Unique constraint on (university_id, organization_id)
- Check before insert: `chapters.university_id = X AND chapters.greek_organization_id = Y`

### Challenge 3: Organization Linking
**Problem:** Match "Sigma Chi" from GreekRank to our `greek_organizations` table

**Solution:**
```typescript
// First, ensure organization exists
const org = await getOrCreateOrganization({
  name: "Sigma Chi",
  greek_letters: "Œ£Œß",
  type: "fraternity"
});

// Then create chapter with organization link
const chapter = await createChapter({
  university_id: uniId,
  greek_organization_id: org.id,
  greekrank_url: "...",
  greek_letters: "Œ£Œß"
});
```
