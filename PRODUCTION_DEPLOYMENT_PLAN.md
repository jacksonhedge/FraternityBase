---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

### 1. Start Production Server (RIGHT NOW)

```bash
cd /Users/jacksonfitzgerald/CollegeOrgNetwork/backend
npm run start:prod
```

This will:
- Start the server with PM2 process management
- Enable automatic restarts on crashes
- Configure production logging
- Monitor system health

### 2. Verify System Status

```bash
# Check server status
pm2 status

# View real-time logs
pm2 logs fraternity-base-backend

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### 3. Setup Automated Monitoring (CRITICAL)

```bash
cd /Users/jacksonfitzgerald/CollegeOrgNetwork/backend
./scripts/setup-cron.sh
```

This configures:
- Database backup every 6 hours
- Health checks every 5 minutes
- Email alerts on system failures

---

## 📧 Email Notification System

### ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
- **Admin Email**: jacksonfitzgerald25@gmail.com
- **Service**: Resend API
- **Test Status**: ✅ Successfully sent test alert

### Email Triggers
1. **New Waitlist Signup** - Immediate notification with stats
2. **System Health Issues** - Critical alerts only
3. **Database Backup Failures** - Immediate notification
4. **Process Crashes** - Automatic alerts

---

## 🗂️ Data Persistence & Backup Strategy

### Database Backup
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours + daily at 2 AM
- **Location**: `/Users/jacksonfitzgerald/CollegeOrgNetwork/backups`
- **Retention**: 30 days (auto-cleanup)
- **Compression**: Files older than 7 days are gzipped
- **Verification**: Each backup integrity tested

### Current Backup Status
✅ **Test backup completed successfully**
- File: `fraternity-base_20250927_043258.db`
- Size: 40KB
- Integrity: Verified

---

## 🔍 System Monitoring

### Health Checks
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
- **Components Monitored**:
  - Backend API responses
  - Database connectivity
  - Disk space usage
  - Process availability

### Alert Thresholds
- **Disk Space**: Warning at 80%, Critical at 90%
- **API Response**: Timeout after 5 seconds
- **Process Down**: Immediate alert with cooldown

## 🛠️ Production Commands

### Process Management
```bash
# Start production
npm run start:prod

# Stop production
npm run stop:prod

# Restart production
npm run restart:prod

# View logs
npm run logs:prod

# Monitor processes
pm2 monit
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Manual backup
npm run backup

# Check database
sqlite3 fraternity-base.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM waitlist;"

# View recent signups
sqlite3 fraternity-base.db "SELECT * FROM waitlist ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

```bash
# Check status
pm2 status

# Restart if needed
pm2 restart fraternity-base-backend

# Check logs for errors
pm2 logs fraternity-base-backend --lines 50
```

### If Database Issues
```bash
# Check database file
ls -la fraternity-base.db

# Test database integrity
sqlite3 fraternity-base.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# Restore from backup if needed
cp /Users/jacksonfitzgerald/CollegeOrgNetwork/backups/[latest-backup].db fraternity-base.db

2. Verify admin email address
3. Test manually: `node scripts/health-check.js`

---

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### When to Scale
- **100+ signups/day**: Consider rate limiting
- **1000+ signups**: Migrate to PostgreSQL
- **High traffic**: Add load balancer

### Current Limits
- **Database**: SQLite handles 100K+ records easily
- **Email**: Resend API (current plan limits)
- **Server**: Single process, can handle 1000+ concurrent users

---

## 🔐 Security Status

✅ **Current Security Measures:**
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- CORS configured for production domains
- Email validation and sanitization
- SQLite injection prevention via prepared statements
- Process isolation via PM2

---

## 📞 SUPPORT & MONITORING

### Real-time Status
- **Server Health**: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
- **Process Status**: `pm2 status`
- **Database Status**: Automatic health checks every 5 minutes

### Getting Help
- **System Logs**: `/Users/jacksonfitzgerald/CollegeOrgNetwork/backend/logs/`
- **Error Debugging**: `pm2 logs fraternity-base-backend`
