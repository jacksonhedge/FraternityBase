## Database Schema Knowledge

- `chapter_name` (varchar) - Name of chapter
- `university_id` (uuid) - FK to universities
- `greek_organization_id` (uuid) - FK to greek_organizations
- `grade` (numeric) - **Critical for reporting** (0-5.0 scale)

## Backend Architecture

### Server: `backend/src/server.ts`

**Port**: 3001 (dev), varies in production

**Key Services**:
- **Supabase Client** (public) - Uses anon key, respects RLS
- **Supabase Admin** (service role) - Bypasses RLS, use for admin operations
- **Resend** - Email service (RESEND_API_KEY)
- **Stripe** - Payment processing
- **Anthropic** - AI assistant

### Important Endpoints

#### Admin Endpoints (require `x-admin-token` header)
```

GET  /api/admin/companies/:id - Company details with unlocks/transactions
GET  /api/admin/chapters - List all chapters
POST /api/admin/chapters - Create chapter
PUT  /api/admin/chapters/:id - Update chapter
```

#### Cron Endpoints (require `x-cron-secret` header)
```
POST /api/cron/grant-monthly-credits - Grant monthly subscription credits

## Client Onboarding Process

### Step 1: User Signs Up
1. User creates account via Supabase Auth
2. User fills out company information
3. Company record created with `approval_status = 'pending'`
4. User profile created, linked to company

### Step 2: Admin Approval
1. Admin reviews company in admin panel
2. Admin approves/rejects company
3. If approved:
   - `approval_status` ‚Üí 'approved'
   - Company gains access to platform
   - **Company starts receiving daily reports**

### Step 3: Company Uses Platform
1. Browse chapters
2. Purchase credits (via Stripe)
3. Unlock chapter data (costs credits)
4. Request warm introductions (for grade 4.5+ chapters)

### Credit System
- **20 credits** = $5.99 (Basic chapters, <3.5 grade)
- **25 credits** = $7.49 (High quality, 4.0-4.4 grade)
- **40 credits** = $11.99 (Premium, 5.0 grade)
- **Warm Introduction** = $59.99 (for grade 4.5+ chapters)

---

## Chapter Grading System (Critical Business Logic)

### Grade Scale: 0 - 5.0

#### **5.0 - Premium** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Full roster (65+ members)
- Complete contact info
- Social media links
- High data quality
- **Unlock Cost**: 40 credits ($11.99)

#### **4.5 - Introducable** ü§ù ‚≠ê
- High-quality verified data
- **SPECIAL**: Warm introduction available ($59.99)
- Partnership network access (College Casino Tour - confidential)
- **Unlock Cost**: 25 credits ($7.49)
- **Competitive Advantage**: This is FraternityBase's secret sauce

#### **4.0-4.4 - High Quality**
- Good data with some contact info
- **Unlock Cost**: 25 credits ($7.49)

#### **3.5-3.9 - Standard**
- Basic complete data
- Social media presence
- **Unlock Cost**: 20 credits ($5.99)

#### **<3.5 - Basic**
- Limited data
- **Unlock Cost**: 20 credits ($5.99)

### Why Grade 4.5 Matters

The **4.5 threshold** is critical because:
1. **Data Quality**: Sufficient verified info for meaningful intros
2. **Relationship Access**: Within partnership network
3. **Success Rate**: Higher conversion via warm referral
4. **Premium Service**: Justifies $59.99 introduction fee
5. **Competitive Moat**: Partnership network is hard to replicate

**Important**: Keep partnership details confidential in client-facing reports.

## Common Queries for Agent

### Get All Approved Companies with Emails
```typescript
const { data: companies } = await supabase
  .from('companies')
  .select(`
    id,
    name,
    user_profiles (user_id)
  `)
  .eq('approval_status', 'approved');

// Then get emails via Supabase Auth
for (const company of companies) {
  const userId = company.user_profiles[0].user_id;
  const { data: user } = await supabase.auth.admin.getUserById(userId);
  const email = user?.user?.email;
}
```

### Get Recent Activity Summary
```sql
-- Last 7 days activity
SELECT
  'New Chapters' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM chapters
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'New Officers' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM chapter_officers
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'Chapter Unlocks' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM chapter_unlocks
WHERE unlocked_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### Get Top Chapters by Grade
```sql
SELECT
  c.chapter_name,
  u.name as university,
  g.name as organization,
  c.grade,
  c.member_count,
  CASE
    WHEN c.grade >= 5.0 THEN 'Premium'
    WHEN c.grade >= 4.5 THEN 'Introducable'
    WHEN c.grade >= 4.0 THEN 'High Quality'
    ELSE 'Standard'
  END as tier
FROM chapters c
LEFT JOIN universities u ON u.id = c.university_id
LEFT JOIN greek_organizations g ON g.id = c.greek_organization_id
WHERE c.is_viewable = true
ORDER BY c.grade DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### Check Data Quality
```sql
-- Chapters missing key data
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE grade IS NULL) as missing_grade,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE member_count IS NULL) as missing_member_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE university_id IS NULL) as missing_university,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE greek_organization_id IS NULL) as missing_organization,
  COUNT(*) as total_chapters
FROM chapters;
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: No new data to report

**Check**:
```sql
SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM chapters;
SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM chapter_officers;
```

**Solution**: Expected if no data added recently. Send report anyway with high-grade chapters.

### Issue: Email not sending

**Resend Error 403**: Domain not verified
- Go to resend.com/domains
- Add fraternitybase.com
- Update FROM_EMAIL in .env
- Redeploy

**No email address for company**:
- Check user_profiles linked to company
- Verify user exists in auth.users
- Ensure approval_status = 'approved'

### Issue: Duplicate companies in results

**Known Issue**: Two "Hedge, Inc." companies in database

**Check**:
```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM companies
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Solution**: Deduplicate when fetching, or merge companies in database

### Issue: Wrong grade calculations

**Business Logic**:
- Grade is stored in `chapters.grade` column
- DO NOT use `five_star_rating` (deprecated)
- Use `grade >= 4.5` for introducable check

**Verify**:
```sql
SELECT
  chapter_name,
  grade,
  five_star_rating,
  CASE WHEN grade >= 4.5 THEN 'Introducable' ELSE 'Standard' END
FROM chapters
WHERE grade IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY grade DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Security & Privacy

### RLS (Row Level Security)

**Tables with RLS**:
- `chapter_unlocks` - Companies can only see their own unlocks
- `balance_transactions` - Companies can only see their own transactions
- `credit_transactions` - Companies can only see their own credits

**Admin Access**:
- Use `supabaseAdmin` client (service role key)
- Bypasses RLS for reporting purposes
- NEVER expose admin client to frontend

### Sensitive Data

**Keep Confidential**:
- Partnership network details (College Casino Tour)
- Specific chapter contact emails/phones (until unlocked)
- Company credit balances (between companies)
- Stripe payment details

**Can Share in Reports**:
- Chapter names, universities
- Grade classifications
- Member counts (aggregate)
- High-level data quality metrics
