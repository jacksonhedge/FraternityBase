# CSV Upload Quick Reference

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Upload Chapter Roster (Most Common)

1. **Get Chapter ID**:
```sql
SELECT id, chapter_name FROM chapters WHERE chapter_name LIKE '%Sigma Chi%';
```

2. **Prepare CSV** with these columns:
```
name,email,position,graduation_year,member_type
```

3. **Upload via API**:
```bash
POST /api/admin/chapters/:chapterId/upload-roster
Header: x-admin-token: YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN
Body: multipart/form-data with 'csv' file
```

4. **Or use AI-assisted**:
```bash
POST /api/admin/process-csv-with-claude
Header: x-admin-token: YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN
Body: multipart/form-data with 'csv' file
Optional: 'prompt' field with instructions
```

## üéØ Grade System (CRITICAL)

For chapters, use these grade values:

| Grade | Meaning | Pricing | Special Feature |
|-------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| 5.0 | Premium | $11.99 (40 credits) | Full roster |
| 4.5 | **Introducable** ü§ù | $7.49 (25 credits) + $59.99 intro | **Warm intro available** |
| 4.0-4.4 | High Quality | $7.49 (25 credits) | - |
| 3.5-3.9 | Standard | $5.99 (20 credits) | - |
| <3.5 | Basic | $5.99 (20 credits) | - |

**Always use 4.5+ for chapters that qualify for warm introductions!**

## üöÄ AI-Assisted Upload (Flexible Format)

**When to use**:
- CSV has non-standard column names
- Don't have UUIDs handy
- Messy or inconsistent data
- Want automatic chapter matching

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/process-csv-with-claude`

**Example Prompt**:
```
"This roster is for Sigma Chi at University of Virginia.
The 'Role' column maps to 'position'.
Anyone with Role='E-Board' should be member_type='officer'."
```

**What Claude Does**:
1. Identifies chapter from context
2. Maps flexible column names
3. Cleans and formats data
4. Validates quality
5. Returns structured JSON

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "chapterId": "uuid-of-matched-chapter",
  "chapterName": "Sigma Chi",
  "universityName": "University of Virginia",
  "members": [...],
  "explanation": "Matched to Sigma Chi Alpha chapter...",
  "warnings": ["10 members missing emails"],
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

## üìä Upload Results

After upload, you'll receive:

```json

  "totalRecords": 50,
  "insertedCount": 35,
  "updatedCount": 15,
  "skippedCount": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

**What counts mean**:

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Always Include Email
Enables deduplication and future updates.

Don't waste time reformatting - let Claude handle it.

### Tip 4: Keep Backups
Save original CSV before upload for rollback if needed.

### Tip 5: Check Activity Log
Verify upload success in admin_activity_log table.

### Tip 6: UTF-8 Encoding

If chapter qualifies for warm intros, always set grade to at least 4.5!
