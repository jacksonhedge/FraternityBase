## What This Tests
This verifies that subscription unlocks now correctly set `amount_paid: 0` in the database, which makes the admin panel show purple "✨ Subscription Unlock" badges instead of gray "💳 Credits" badges.

# 🧪 COMPREHENSIVE AMOUNT_PAID FIX VERIFICATION

## Context
I'm testing a critical fix where subscription unlocks were incorrectly storing the credit cost in `amount_paid` instead of `0`. This caused the admin panel to show all unlocks as credit purchases instead of subscription unlocks.

## Pre-Test Setup (CRITICAL)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Login with jacksonfitzgerald25@gmail.com (if not already logged in)
3. Find "Hedge, Inc." in the company list
4. Click "View Details" to open the company modal
5. Record the current values:
   - Credits balance
   - 5⭐ unlocks remaining
   - 4⭐ unlocks remaining
   - 3⭐ unlocks remaining
6. Close the modal

## Test Execution

### PART 1: Test Subscription Unlock (5.0⭐ Chapter)

**Step 1.1: Navigate to a 5-star chapter**
- Go to Universities tab
- Search for "University of Illinois"
- Click on it to view chapters
- Find "Alpha Delta Phi" chapter (should have 5.0⭐ rating)
- Click "View Details" on the chapter

**Step 1.2: Unlock the chapter**
- In the chapter details modal, click the "Unlock Full Chapter" button
- Verify the unlock modal appears with:
  - Purple background for subscription unlock
  - "✨ Use Subscription Unlock" section
  - Shows "5⭐ Unlocks: 5 remaining" (or current count)
  - $0.00 cost
- Click "Unlock Chapter" to confirm
- Wait for success notification

**Step 1.3: Verify real-time updates**
Record the new values:
- Credits balance (should be UNCHANGED)
- 5⭐ unlocks remaining (should decrease by 1)
- Navbar should update immediately

**Step 1.4: Check admin panel unlock history**
- Click "Admin" in navbar
- Find "Hedge, Inc." and click "View Details"
- Look at the "Recent Chapter Unlocks" section
- Find the Alpha Delta Phi unlock
- **CRITICAL CHECK**: Verify it shows:
  - Purple badge: "✨ Subscription Unlock"
  - Star rating: "5.0⭐"
  - Cost: "$0.00"
  - NOT a gray "💳 Credits" badge

### PART 2: Test Credit Fallback (Exhaust Subscription Unlocks)

**Step 2.1: Exhaust all 5⭐ subscription unlocks**
Using the same University of Illinois chapters, unlock 4 more 5-star chapters:
- Unlock each chapter and verify:
  - Modal shows subscription unlock option
  - Credits don't decrease
  - 5⭐ count decreases
- After 5 unlocks, verify 5⭐ remaining shows 0

**Step 2.2: Test credit fallback**
- Try to unlock a 6th 5-star chapter
- Verify the modal now shows:
  - "💳 Pay with Credits" section (not subscription)
  - Shows credit cost (e.g., "10 credits ($9.90)")
  - Credits balance display
- Click "Unlock Chapter" to confirm
- Verify:
  - Credits balance DECREASES by the cost
  - 5⭐ unlocks remain at 0

**Step 2.3: Verify credit unlock in admin panel**
- Go back to Admin panel
- View "Hedge, Inc." details
- Find the 6th unlock in history
- **CRITICAL CHECK**: Verify it shows:
  - Gray badge: "💳 Credits"
  - Credit cost (e.g., "10 credits")
  - Dollar amount (e.g., "$9.90")
  - NOT a purple subscription unlock badge

## Expected Results

### ✅ PASS Criteria:
1. Subscription unlocks (first 5) show purple "✨ Subscription Unlock" badges in admin panel
2. All subscription unlocks show "$0.00" cost
3. Credit unlock (6th unlock) shows gray "💳 Credits" badge
4. Credit unlock shows actual cost in credits and dollars
5. Credits balance stays constant during subscription unlocks
6. Credits balance decreases during credit unlock
7. Subscription unlock counts decrease properly
8. Real-time updates work in navbar and admin panel

### ❌ FAIL Criteria:
1. Subscription unlocks show gray "💳 Credits" badges instead of purple
2. Subscription unlocks show credit cost instead of $0.00
3. Credits decrease during subscription unlocks
4. Admin panel doesn't distinguish between subscription and credit unlocks
5. Any unlock shows incorrect badge or cost

## SQL Query to Verify Database (Run in Supabase)

After the test, run this to confirm `amount_paid` values in database:

```sql
-- Check the last 6 unlocks for Hedge, Inc.
SELECT
  cu.id,
  cu.unlocked_at,
  cu.amount_paid,
  cu.unlock_type,
  c.chapter_name,
  c.grade,
  bt.transaction_type,
  bt.amount as transaction_amount
FROM chapter_unlocks cu
JOIN chapters c ON cu.chapter_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN balance_transactions bt ON cu.transaction_id = bt.id
WHERE cu.company_id = (
  SELECT id FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Hedge, Inc.'
)
ORDER BY cu.unlocked_at DESC
LIMIT 6;
```

**Expected Results:**
- First 5 unlocks: `amount_paid: 0`, `transaction_type: null`
- 6th unlock: `amount_paid: 10` (or actual cost), `transaction_type: 'debit'`

## Reset Script (If You Need to Re-Test)

```sql
-- Reset Hedge, Inc. subscription unlocks
UPDATE account_balance
SET
  unlocks_5_star_remaining = 5,
  unlocks_4_star_remaining = 5,
  unlocks_3_star_remaining = 10,
  warm_intros_remaining = 1
WHERE company_id = (
  SELECT id FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Hedge, Inc.'
);

-- Delete recent test unlocks (optional)
DELETE FROM chapter_unlocks
WHERE company_id = (
  SELECT id FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Hedge, Inc.'
)
AND unlocked_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Restore credits (optional - adjust amount as needed)
UPDATE account_balance
SET balance_credits = 600
WHERE company_id = (
  SELECT id FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Hedge, Inc.'
);
```

## Fix Details

**File:** `/Users/jacksonfitzgerald/CollegeOrgNetwork/backend/src/server.ts`
**Line:** 1327
**Change:**
```typescript
// Before:
amount_paid: credits,  // Always set to credit cost

// After:
amount_paid: finalAmountPaid,  // 0 for subscription, credits for credit unlock
```

Where `finalAmountPaid = useSubscriptionUnlock ? 0 : credits`

This ensures:
- Subscription unlocks → `amount_paid: 0` → Purple badge in admin
- Credit unlocks → `amount_paid: actual_cost` → Gray badge in admin
