## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Upload logos for 3 conference universities:**
   - University of Virginia (ACC)
   - University of Utah (Big 12)
   - Oregon State University (PAC-12)

2. **Logo Fallback System:**
   - ‚úÖ Already implemented: `getCollegeLogoWithFallback()`
   - Verify fallback generates attractive placeholders (university initials, school colors, etc.)

### Short-Term Actions (Medium Priority)
3. **Batch Logo Upload for Top 100 Universities:**
   - Focus on universities with most chapters
   - Query: `SELECT university_id, COUNT(*) FROM chapters GROUP BY university_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 100`

4. **Logo API Integration:**
   - Consider using Clearbit Logo API, Google Custom Search, or Wikipedia API
   - Automate logo fetching for remaining 1,000+ universities

### Long-Term Actions (Low Priority)
5. **Community Contribution:**
   - Allow users to suggest/upload logos (with admin approval)
   - Gamify logo contributions with rewards

6. **Data Quality Dashboard:**
   - Admin panel showing % of universities with logos
   - Track logo upload progress over time

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Logo Fallback Function Location
- **File:** `/Users/jacksonfitzgerald/CollegeOrgNetwork/frontend/src/utils/collegeLogos.ts`
- **Function:** `getCollegeLogoWithFallback(universityName: string)`

### Usage in ChaptersPage ListView
- **File:** `ChaptersPage.tsx:543`
```typescript
<img
  src={chapter.universities?.logo_url || getCollegeLogoWithFallback(chapter.universities?.name || '')}
  alt={chapter.universities?.name || ''}
  className="w-10 h-10 rounded-lg object-contain"
/>
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- universities table
logo_url TEXT  -- Can be NULL, '', or 'undefined'
```

**Issue:** Need to clean up inconsistent empty values:
- `NULL` ‚úÖ Correct
- `''` (empty string) ‚ö†Ô∏è Should be NULL
- `'undefined'` ‚ùå Should be NULL

### Cleanup Query
```sql
UPDATE universities
SET logo_url = NULL
WHERE logo_url = '' OR logo_url = 'undefined';
```
