## üîç Critical Debug Questions

### Question 1: ViewMode Transition
After clicking a state, does the console show:
```
üó∫Ô∏è State clicked: [State] Colleges: [X] ViewMode set to: state
üìä Render - viewMode: state selectedStateData: YES
```

**Answer**: YES / NO / PARTIAL

If PARTIAL, which logs appear and which don't?

---

### Question 2: Component Re-rendering
After viewMode changes to "state", do the info boxes re-render?

Look for: Does the page "flash" or update visually after clicking a state?

**Answer**: YES / NO

---

### Question 3: DOM Inspection
When zoomed to California with console showing viewMode=state:

**Action**:
1. Right-click info box area
2. Inspect Element
3. Look for conditional rendering

**Find**: Is there a section with `viewMode === 'state' && selectedStateData`?

**Report**: What HTML is rendered in that conditional section?

---

### Question 4: CircleMarker Elements
**Action**:
1. Zoom to California
2. Open Elements tab in DevTools
3. Search (Ctrl+F) for "CircleMarker" or "leaflet-pane"

**Report**:
- CircleMarker elements found: [count]
- Parent container: [class name]
- Visible in DOM: YES/NO
- CSS display property: [value]
