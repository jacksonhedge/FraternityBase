   - Credits & Pricing
   - Company Intelligence
   - Business Analytics

4. Each tab will load its respective component
5. Use filters and export features as needed

## üìä Data Flow

Currently using placeholder data. To connect real data:

1. Implement backend API endpoints (see Phase 6 above)
2. Update component `fetchData()` functions to call real APIs
3. Replace placeholder stats with actual database queries
4. Connect to Stripe for payment data
5. Query `chapter_unlocks` table for unlock analytics
6. Query `companies` and `account_balance` for intelligence metrics

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Create remaining tab components (Unlocks, Credits, Intelligence, Analytics)
2. Import components into AdminPageV4.tsx
3. Add conditional rendering for each tab
4. Build backend API endpoints
5. Connect real data to components
6. Add charts/visualizations (Chart.js or Recharts)
7. Implement CSV export functionality
8. Add real-time updates with WebSockets (optional)
