## Database Queries You Can Run

### Check what data exists:
```sql
-- Count everything
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM greek_organizations) as orgs,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM universities) as universities,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chapters) as chapters,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chapter_officers) as officers;

-- See all chapters with details
SELECT
  c.chapter_name,
  go.name as fraternity,
  u.name as university,
  c.member_count,
  c.instagram_handle
FROM chapters c
JOIN greek_organizations go ON c.greek_organization_id = go.id
JOIN universities u ON c.university_id = u.id;

-- See all officers
SELECT
  co.name,
  co.position,
  co.email,
  co.phone,
  c.chapter_name,
  go.name as fraternity,
  u.name as university
FROM chapter_officers co
JOIN chapters c ON co.chapter_id = c.id
JOIN greek_organizations go ON c.greek_organization_id = go.id
JOIN universities u ON c.university_id = u.id;
```

---

## Image Upload Implementation

### How It Works:

1. **Frontend** - User selects image file
2. **Convert to Base64** - JavaScript FileReader converts to data URL
3. **POST to API** - Send base64 data to `/api/admin/upload-image`
4. **Backend** - Convert base64 → Buffer → Upload to Supabase Storage
5. **Get Public URL** - Supabase returns public CDN URL
6. **Save to Database** - Store URL in `logo_url` field

### Supabase Storage Buckets:

```
college-logos/
  ├── penn-state.png
  ├── alabama.png
  └── ohio-state.png

fraternity-logos/
  ├── sigma-chi.png
  ├── pike.png
  └── sae.png
```

All images are **publicly accessible** via URL like:
```
https://vvsawtexgpopqxgaqyxg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/college-logos/penn-state.png
```

## Credit System Integration

When companies browse chapters:

1. **Free to Browse** - See all chapter names, universities, sizes
2. **25 Credits** - Unlock basic roster (member names only)
3. **50 Credits** - Unlock officer contacts (emails/phones)
4. **100 Credits** - Unlock full access (everything)

### What Gets Unlocked:

**Roster View (25 credits):**
- Chapter name
- Member count
- House address
- Social media

**Officer Contacts (50 credits):**
- All officer names
- Positions
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers

**Full Access (100 credits):**
- Everything above +
- LinkedIn profiles
- Graduation years
- Majors
- Personal details

## Next Steps

### To Complete Your Admin System:

1. **Add the other tabs** to AdminPageV4.tsx
   - Copy the fraternity CRUD pattern
   - Apply to Universities, Chapters, Officers

2. **Test the full flow:**
   ```bash
   # Add data via admin panel
   1. Add a new fraternity
   2. Add a new university
   3. Add a chapter connecting them
   4. Add officers for that chapter

   # View as company
   5. Log in as a company
   6. Browse chapters → see your new data
   7. Unlock chapter → see officer contacts
   ```

3. **Populate more data:**
   - Add more universities (target 50-100)
   - Add more chapters per university (5-10 each)
   - Add 3-5 officers per chapter
   - Upload logos for top schools

4. **Image optimization:**
   - Resize logos to 256x256px
   - Use PNG with transparency
   - Keep file sizes under 100KB

## API Testing

### Test with cURL:

```bash
# List all fraternities
curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/greek-organizations

# Create a new fraternity
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/greek-organizations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Delta Tau Delta",
    "greek_letters": "ΔΤΔ",
    "organization_type": "fraternity",
    "founded_year": 1858
  }'

# Update a fraternity
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/admin/greek-organizations/SOME-UUID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"total_chapters": 130}'

# Delete a fraternity
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/admin/greek-organizations/SOME-UUID
```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend not saving data?
- Check Supabase connection in `.env`
- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Check backend console for errors

### Images not uploading?
- Ensure storage buckets exist (run the SQL above)
- Check file size (must be under 5MB)
- Verify bucket is set to `public = true`

### Can't see new data on company dashboard?
- Refresh the page
- Check if company dashboard is using API or mock data
- Look for hardcoded mock arrays in `DashboardPage.tsx`
