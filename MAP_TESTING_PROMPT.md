# Map Testing Prompt for Claude Chrome

## Objective
Test the FraternityBase map functionality to identify issues with state clicks, college display, and data consistency.

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Navigate to the Map
- Go to https://fraternitybase.com
- Log in if needed
- Navigate to the Map page

### 2. Test State Click Functionality
For each of the following states, click on the state and report:
- **West Virginia**
- **Virginia**
- **Louisiana**
- **California**
- **Oregon**
- **Washington**

For each state, document:
1. ‚úÖ Does the state highlight when clicked?
2. ‚úÖ Does the right sidebar panel appear?
3. ‚úÖ What does the panel show?
   - State name
   - Number of colleges listed
   - Actual college names visible
4. ‚úÖ Check the browser console for any debug logs (look for üó∫Ô∏è, üìç, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚ùå emojis)
5. ‚ùå Any errors or issues?

### 3. Test Power 5 Filter
- Click the "Power 5" filter button
- Document which states light up on the map
- Click on the following Power 5 states:
  - **Louisiana** (should show LSU)
  - **California** (should show Stanford, Cal, USC, UCLA)
  - **Tennessee** (should show University of Tennessee)
  - **Texas** (should show University of Texas, Texas A&M)

For each state, report:
- How many colleges appear in the sidebar?
- Which specific colleges are listed?
- Do they match expected Power 5 schools?

### 4. Console Debugging
Open browser console (F12) and look for messages like:
- `‚ö†Ô∏è No abbreviation found for state:` [state name]
- `üó∫Ô∏è State clicked:` [state name] `Abbr:` [abbreviation]
- `üìç Found X colleges in [state]`

**Report all console messages for the states tested above.**

### 5. Data Consistency Check
For West Virginia specifically:
1. Click on the state
2. Check console for: `üìç Found X colleges in WV`
3. If X = 0, report: "No colleges found in database for West Virginia"
4. If X > 0 but sidebar is empty, report: "Colleges found but not displaying"
5. Check if there's a filter active (Power 5, Big 10, etc.) that might be hiding colleges

### 6. Expected Results
Based on the code, here's what SHOULD happen:

**West Virginia:**
- Should have West Virginia University (WVU) - Big 12 conference
- Should show in Power 5 filter (Big 12 is Power 5)
- Console should show: `üìç Found X colleges in WV` where X ‚â• 1

**Virginia:**
- Should show UVA, Virginia Tech (both ACC)
- Should show multiple colleges in sidebar

**Louisiana:**
- Should show LSU (SEC)
- Should appear when Power 5 filter is active
