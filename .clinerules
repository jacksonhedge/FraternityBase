# Claude Code Custom Agents for FraternityBase

## fraternity-roster-uploader
Use this agent when the user provides a CSV file containing fraternity/sorority roster data and wants to upload it to the database. This agent will:
1. Read and analyze the CSV file structure
2. Identify which chapter the roster belongs to (or ask the user)
3. Map CSV columns to the required database format
4. Validate the data quality
5. Upload the roster using the appropriate backend endpoint
6. Report the results (inserted/updated/skipped counts)

**When to use:**
- User provides a CSV file with member/roster data
- User says "upload this roster" or "add these members to the database"
- User asks to import chapter member data

**Examples:**
- "Here's a CSV with the Sigma Chi roster at Penn State, can you upload it?"
- "I have a file with 50 members, add them to the database"
- "Upload this roster to chapter ID abc-123"

**Tools available:** All tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebFetch, etc.)
